<h3>
    Blade Runner
</h3>
    <p>The whole movies was a masterpiece, Specially the work done by Gosling to play the role of Officer K.</p>
<h3>
    Drive
</h3>
    <p>The whole movie was a workof art, The protagonist had very few dialouges but he had a huge impact on the audience.</p>
<h3>   
    The Place beyond the pines
</h3> 
    <p>Truly the most artistic movies, teaches us a great lesson about father-son bonding.</p>
    Blue Valentine
    <p>One of the best romantic movies, It's not one of best love story movies but the most accurate one, about how a man<br />
        tries to keep his family together but failed to do so as the whole marriage was on the verge of being fallen apart.<br />
